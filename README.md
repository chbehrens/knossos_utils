# Knossos Python-Tools
This repository serves as a place for python code that interacts with **KNOSSOS** data sets or annotation files. However, the code here is standalone and you won't find **KNOSSOS-Plugins** here (but feel free to be inspired by it when writing plugins).

# DatasetUtils
DatasetUtils provides a class representation of a **KNOSSOS**-dataset for reading and writing raw and overlay data. It can also create **KNOSSOS**-datasets from scratch by writing knossos.conf's and creating the necessary directories.
