# Knossos Python-Tools
This repo serves as a place for python files that interact with data in **KNOSSOS**, but are no **KNOSSOS-Plugins**.

# DatasetUtils
DatasetUtils provides a class representation of a **KNOSSOS**-dataset for reading and writing raw and overlay data. It can also create **KNOSSOS**-datasets from scratch by writing knossos.conf's and creating the necessary directories.
